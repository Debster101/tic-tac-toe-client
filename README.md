Project 1 - Tic Tac Toe

Link: https://debster101.github.io/tic-tac-toe-client/

Overview
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I created a game of Tic Tac Toe.

I built a a single page application (SPA) that allows someone to create an account, or sign back in.
I reviewed all documentation related to the project.  I created the wireframes and user stories.  I setup my authentication witht API and then started my game logic.  I used pseudocode and comments to help me. I tested the code by logging messages to the console and help me debug issues.

Tech used
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Javascript
* jQuery
* bootstrap
* CSS
* HTML

Problems
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have an error message that pops up when I have complications with updating the API, but I think this would be confusing for the user. The user has to click New Game button to play a game.  Changing this in the future would to have the user click on the gameboard to start a game would be ideal.  I was focusing on meet requirements for the project and didn't put much focus on styling.  I would like to add a template and more formatting.
